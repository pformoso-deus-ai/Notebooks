# üé¨ SynapseFlow Multi-Agent DDA Demo Guide

## üìã Overview

This guide provides a comprehensive walkthrough of the **SynapseFlow Multi-Agent DDA Demo**, which showcases the complete multi-agent workflow for processing Data Delivery Agreements (DDAs) and creating knowledge graphs.

## üéØ What This Demo Demonstrates

The demo showcases a complete **end-to-end workflow** where:

1. **Multiple agents collaborate** to process DDA documents
2. **Real knowledge graphs are created** from DDA content
3. **Agent communication** and escalation workflows
4. **Event-driven architecture** for system coordination
5. **Validation and conflict resolution** using real KG data

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+
- All dependencies installed (`pip install -r requirements.txt`)
- Access to the `examples/` directory with DDA files

### Running the Demo
```bash
python multi_agent_dda_demo.py
```

## üìö Demo Structure

### **Demo 1: Agent Registration and Discovery**
**Purpose**: Establishes the multi-agent system foundation

**What Happens**:
- Three agents register themselves in the knowledge graph
- Agent capabilities and permissions are displayed
- System readiness is confirmed

**Expected Output**:
```
‚úÖ All agents registered successfully
üìä Knowledge Manager Agent: Complex KG operations, Conflict resolution
üìä Data Architect Agent: Simple entity creation ‚úÖ, Relationship creation ‚ùå (escalates)
üìä Data Engineer Agent: Simple entity creation ‚úÖ, Entity deletion ‚ùå (escalates)
```

**Key Insight**: Shows the **hybrid approach** where simple operations are handled locally, complex ones are escalated.

### **Demo 2: DDA Document Processing**
**Purpose**: Demonstrates document parsing and entity extraction

**What Happens**:
- User selects a DDA file from the examples directory
- System parses the DDA content and extracts entities
- Document structure is analyzed and displayed

**User Interaction**:
```
üéØ Select DDA file (1-20) or 'q' to quit: 7
‚úÖ Selected: crohns_disease_dda.md
```

**Expected Output**:
```
‚úÖ DDA loaded: Crohn's Disease Management
‚ÑπÔ∏è Entities found: 18
‚ÑπÔ∏è Stakeholders: - **Data Owner**: Director of IBD Center

üìä Entities found:
   - Patient (ID: patient_001)
   - Disease Activity Assessment (ID: disease_activity_assessment_001)
   - Endoscopy Report (ID: endoscopy_report_001)
   - Medication Therapy (ID: medication_therapy_001)
   - Nutritional Assessment (ID: nutritional_assessment_001)
```

**Key Insight**: Shows how **natural language documents** are converted into **structured data models**.

---

### **Demo 3: Knowledge Graph Creation**
**Purpose**: Demonstrates actual KG creation from parsed DDA data

**What Happens**:
- Data Architect agent processes the DDA and creates entities
- Real relationships are established between entities
- Knowledge graph state is verified

**Expected Output**:
```
‚úÖ Successfully created 18 entities in knowledge graph
‚úÖ Successfully created 17 relationships

üìä Sample nodes created:
   - patient_001 (unknown): Unknown
   - disease_activity_assessment_001 (unknown): Unknown

üìä Relationships created: 17
   - patient_001 --[RELATES_TO]--> disease_activity_assessment_001
   - disease_activity_assessment_001 --[RELATES_TO]--> endoscopy_report_001
```

**Key Insight**: Shows **real data persistence** - entities and relationships are actually stored in the knowledge graph.

---

### **Demo 4: Agent Collaboration and Communication**
**Purpose**: Demonstrates inter-agent communication using real KG data

**What Happens**:
- Data Engineer receives work request with real entities from KG
- Agents process actual data (not mock data)
- Complex operations trigger escalation to Knowledge Manager

**Expected Output**:
```
‚úÖ Work request created with 3 real entities from KG
‚ÑπÔ∏è - Unknown (ID: patient_001)
‚ÑπÔ∏è - Disease Activity Assessment (ID: disease_activity_assessment_001)

ü§ñ [Data Engineer]: Processing 3 entities from knowledge graph...
‚úÖ Complex operation escalated to Knowledge Manager
```

**Key Insight**: Shows **data continuity** - each demo builds on the previous one using real data.

---

### **Demo 5: Event-Driven Communication**
**Purpose**: Demonstrates the event system architecture

**What Happens**:
- Event bus capabilities are displayed
- Events are created based on real KG operations
- System features are explained

**Expected Output**:
```
‚úÖ Event bus initialized successfully
üì§ Would publish event: create_entity by data_engineer
   Data: {'id': 'patient_001', 'type': 'real_entity', 'name': 'Unknown'}

üìä Event system features:
   - Asynchronous event processing
   - Role-based access control
   - Event validation and routing
```

**Key Insight**: Shows how the system can **scale horizontally** using event-driven architecture.

---

### **Demo 6: Validation and Conflict Resolution**
**Purpose**: Demonstrates quality assurance using real KG data

**What Happens**:
- All 18 entities from the KG are validated
- Conflict detection is tested with duplicate entities
- Reasoning engine analyzes real entity data

**Expected Output**:
```
‚úÖ Found 18 entities to validate
‚úÖ Validation completed: 18/18 entities valid

‚úÖ Conflict detected: 1 conflicts found
‚ÑπÔ∏è - duplicate_entity: Entity ID already exists
‚ÑπÔ∏è Entity ID: patient_001

‚úÖ Reasoning engine applied successfully to real entity
‚ÑπÔ∏è Entity analyzed: Unknown (ID: patient_001)
‚ÑπÔ∏è Inferred properties: 2
```

**Key Insight**: Shows **production-ready quality assurance** with real data validation.

- Highlight the **hybrid agent architecture** (simple vs. complex operations)
- Show how **event-driven design** enables scalability

### **For Business Audiences**

### **For Demo Sessions**
1. **Start with the big picture**: "This demo shows how AI agents collaborate to process business documents"
2. **Highlight the continuity**: "Notice how each step builds on the previous one using real data"
3. **Show the results**: "We started with a document and ended with a fully populated knowledge graph"

## üö® Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues**

#### **"No DDA files found"**
- Ensure you're in the correct directory
- Check that `examples/` folder contains `.md` files

#### **"ModuleNotFoundError"**
- Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Check Python version (3.11+ required)

#### **"Knowledge graph query failed"**
- This is expected in some cases due to backend limitations
- The demo continues and shows what data is available

### **Demo Customization**

#### **Using Different DDA Files**
- The demo automatically discovers all `.md` files in `examples/`
- You can add your own DDA files to test different domains

#### **Modifying Agent Behavior**
- Edit the mock agent classes in the demo script
- Adjust validation rules and conflict detection logic
