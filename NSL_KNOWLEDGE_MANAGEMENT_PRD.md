# Neurosymbolic Knowledge Management PRD

## Overview
This document describes the requirements for implementing neurosymbolic knowledge management in the multi-agent system. The goal is to combine neural extraction and symbolic reasoning for robust, scalable, and explainable knowledge graph (KG) management.

## Goals
- Integrate neural extraction (from DDA and other documents) with symbolic KG management.
- Support both agent-driven and centralized knowledge management workflows.
- Enable layered knowledge organization (perception, semantic, reasoning, application).
- Ensure consistency, scalability, and explainability in KG updates.

## User Stories
- As a Data Architect, I want extracted entities and relationships from documents to be automatically added to the KG, so I can focus on higher-level modeling.
- As a Data Engineer, I want to query and update the KG with confidence that updates are validated and consistent.
- As a Knowledge Manager, I want to review, validate, and reason over KG updates, and resolve conflicts or inconsistencies.
- As a System Admin, I want to monitor KG operations, performance, and audit trails.

## Requirements
- R1: Support both dedicated and integrated knowledge management workflows (configurable).
- R2: Implement event-driven or API-based KG update mechanism.
- R3: Organize knowledge into layers: perception, semantic, reasoning, application.
- R4: Provide clear policies for direct vs. escalated KG updates.
- R5: Enable batch and concurrent processing of KG updates.
- R6: Support audit trails, rollback, and error recovery for KG operations.
- R7: Expose monitoring and metrics for KG management.
- R8: Document all APIs, workflows, and policies.

## Success Criteria
- End-to-end tests for both agent-driven and centralized KG management.
- Performance benchmarks for batch and concurrent updates.
- Demonstrated rollback and error recovery.
- Documentation and user guides for all workflows.
