# Neurosymbolic Knowledge Management PRD

## Overview
This document describes the requirements for implementing neurosymbolic knowledge management in the multi-agent system. The goal is to combine neural extraction and symbolic reasoning for robust, scalable, and explainable knowledge graph (KG) management.

## Goals
- Integrate neural extraction (from DDA and other documents) with symbolic KG management.
- Support both agent-driven and centralized knowledge management workflows (hybrid, configurable).
- Enable layered knowledge organization (perception, semantic, reasoning, application).
- Ensure consistency, scalability, and explainability in KG updates.
- Support multiple document types via MarkItDown (Markdown, PDF, DOCX, etc.).
- Support multiple KG backends (Graphiti, FalkorDB for local/dev).
- Integrate with MCP for side services and future extensibility.

## User Stories
- As a Data Architect, I want extracted entities and relationships from documents (any format) to be automatically added to the KG, so I can focus on higher-level modeling.
- As a Data Engineer, I want to query and update the KG with confidence that updates are validated and consistent.
- As a Knowledge Manager, I want to review, validate, and reason over KG updates, and resolve conflicts or inconsistencies.
- As a System Admin, I want to monitor KG operations, performance, and audit trails.

## Requirements
- R1: Support both dedicated and integrated knowledge management workflows (hybrid, configurable).
- R2: Implement event-driven or API-based KG update mechanism using FastAPI and RabbitMQ (Flink for future stream processing).
- R3: Organize knowledge into layers: perception, semantic, reasoning, application.
- R4: Provide clear policies for direct vs. escalated KG updates.
- R5: Enable batch and concurrent processing of KG updates (updates after task completion, with queueing).
- R6: Support audit trails, rollback, and error recovery for KG operations (future phases).
- R7: Expose monitoring and metrics for KG management using OpenLLMetry.
- R8: Document all APIs, workflows, and policies in Markdown (docs/specs folder).
- R9: Support dynamic and extendable ontology/schema (no unified schema required for this phase).
- R10: Basic RBAC for access control (four roles: Data Architect, Data Engineer, Knowledge Manager, System Admin).
- R11: Integrate with MCP for side service communication and extensibility.
- R12: Allow for model backend replacement (e.g., OpenAI â†’ Ollama).

## Success Criteria
- End-to-end tests for both agent-driven and centralized KG management.
- Performance benchmarks for batch and concurrent updates.
- Demonstrated rollback and error recovery (future phases).
- Documentation and user guides for all workflows (Markdown, docs/specs folder).
- MarkItDown integration for document conversion.
- Configurable KG backend (Graphiti, FalkorDB).
- OpenLLMetry telemetry for agent flows.
- MCP integration for side services.
