# Development Plan: Neurosymbolic Knowledge Management

## Phase 1: Architecture & Design
- [ ] Finalize requirements and PRD
- [ ] Design layered knowledge architecture (perception, semantic, reasoning, application)
- [ ] Choose between dedicated agent, integrated, or hybrid approach (or make configurable)
- [ ] Define event-driven/API-based update mechanism

## Phase 2: Core Implementation
- [ ] Implement knowledge management agent/service (if chosen)
- [ ] Integrate KG update logic into agents (if chosen)
- [ ] Implement event bus or API for KG operations
- [ ] Implement layered knowledge organization in codebase

## Phase 3: Advanced Features
- [ ] Add audit trail, rollback, and error recovery for KG updates
- [ ] Implement batch and concurrent processing
- [ ] Add monitoring and metrics for KG management

## Phase 4: Testing & Documentation
- [ ] End-to-end and integration tests for all workflows
- [ ] Performance and scalability benchmarks
- [ ] Complete user and technical documentation
