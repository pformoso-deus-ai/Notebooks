# Development Plan: Metadata Graph Management

This plan outlines incremental phases to implement metadata graph management for DDAs. Phases may overlap depending on resources and feedback.

## Phase 1 – Ontology & Schema Definition

- Consolidate the metadata entities and relationships from the PRD into a formal ontology.
- Document node and edge types with attributes (including IDs, names, descriptions, types).
- Define guidelines for extending the ontology to accommodate future assets (e.g., file systems, data streams).

## Phase 2 – DDA Parser Implementation

- Select supported DDA formats (Markdown, CSV, JSON) and define a schema for input documents.
- Implement parser classes deriving from `MetadataParser` to convert documents into structured metadata objects.
- Write unit tests for parser accuracy and error handling.

## Phase 3 – Metadata Modeler & Graph Interface

- Implement the `MetadataModeler` to map structured metadata into Graphiti or Neo4j entities.
- Build a Graph API (REST/gRPC) for create/update/query operations.
- Set up an event bus (RabbitMQ) and define message schemas for asynchronous updates.

## Phase 4 – Knowledge Management Logic

- Develop the `KnowledgeManagerAgent` to perform validation, reasoning and conflict resolution.
- Implement rule sets for validating relationships and detecting duplicates or inconsistencies.
- Add rollback functionality and audit logging.

## Phase 5 – Agent Integration & Workflow Automation

- Integrate the parser and modeler into existing agents (Data Architect, Data Engineer).
- Implement the workflow to fetch DDAs, parse them, emit events and handle responses.
- Support batch and concurrent processing with queue management.

## Phase 6 – Backends & Extensibility

- Configure Graphiti as the primary backend and set up Neo4j or FalkorDB for development/testing.
- Implement configuration toggles for knowledge management mode (dedicated, integrated, hybrid).
- Integrate MCP for side services and prepare for model backend replacements.

## Phase 7 – Documentation & Testing

- Create developer and user guides covering API usage, workflows and ontology.
- Document architecture diagrams and sequence flows.
- Write end‑to‑end tests demonstrating DDA ingestion and graph operations.
- Set up monitoring and metrics with OpenLLMetry.

## Phase 8 – Deployment & Feedback

- Deploy the solution in a staging environment and collect feedback from stakeholders.
- Iterate on ontology refinements, rule sets and API design.
