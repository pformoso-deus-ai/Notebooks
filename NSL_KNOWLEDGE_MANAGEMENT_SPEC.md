# Technical Specification: Neurosymbolic Knowledge Management

## 1. Architecture Overview
- **Layered Knowledge Model:**
  - Perception Layer: Neural extraction of entities/relations from documents
  - Semantic Layer: Mapping to ontology/KG, normalization, linking
  - Reasoning Layer: Symbolic rules, validation, inference
  - Application Layer: Agent/user interaction, queries, updates
- **Knowledge Management Approaches:**
  - Dedicated agent/service, integrated agent logic, or hybrid (configurable)
- **Event-Driven/API-Based Updates:**
  - Agents emit events or call API for KG operations
  - Knowledge manager processes events/requests, updates KG, applies reasoning

## 2. Components
- **KnowledgeManagerAgent/Service** (optional): Handles centralized KG updates, validation, reasoning
- **Agent KG Update Logic:** For integrated approach, agents update KG directly
- **Event Bus/API:** For decoupled communication and batch/concurrent processing
- **Layered KG Data Structures:** Classes/modules for each knowledge layer
- **Audit & Monitoring:** Logging, rollback, metrics

## 3. Interfaces
- **KG Update API:** REST/gRPC endpoints for create/update/query KG
- **Event Schema:** Standardized event format for KG operations
- **Agent Interfaces:** Methods for submitting, escalating, or validating KG updates
- **Monitoring API:** Expose metrics and audit logs

## 4. Workflows
- **Neural Extraction â†’ KG Update:**
  1. Agent extracts entities/relations from document
  2. Agent emits event or calls API with extracted data
  3. Knowledge manager validates, applies rules, updates KG
  4. Audit/logging, error handling, and feedback to agent
- **Batch/Concurrent Processing:**
  - Multiple agents or documents processed in parallel, with conflict resolution
- **Rollback/Error Recovery:**
  - On failure, revert KG to previous state, notify agents

## 5. Layered Knowledge Organization
- **Perception Layer:** Extraction models, input adapters
- **Semantic Layer:** Ontology mapping, entity/relationship classes
- **Reasoning Layer:** Rule engine, validation logic
- **Application Layer:** Agent APIs, user interfaces, analytics

## 6. Configuration & Extensibility
- Support for switching between dedicated, integrated, or hybrid management
- Pluggable event bus/API implementations
- Extensible rule and ontology modules

## 7. Security & Access Control
- Role-based permissions for KG operations
- Validation and sanitization of all inputs

## 8. Documentation
- API reference, user/developer guides, architecture diagrams
