# Modeling Command Feature - Product Requirements Document

## Overview
The Modeling Command feature enables the Data Architect agent to process business requirements documents (DDAs - Data Delivery Agreements) and create or update domain-specific knowledge graphs using Graphiti. This feature streamlines the data modeling workflow by automating the transformation of business requirements into structured knowledge representations.

## Objectives
- Automate the creation and maintenance of domain-specific knowledge graphs from business requirements
- Provide a standardized workflow for processing DDAs (Data Delivery Agreements)
- Enable the Data Architect to efficiently model data domains using Graphiti
- Support iterative refinement of knowledge graphs based on evolving requirements
- Maintain traceability between business requirements and knowledge graph elements

## Functional Requirements

### 1. DDA Processing
- **Input**: Business requirements documents in various formats (PDF, DOCX, TXT, Markdown)
- **Parsing**: Extract structured information from unstructured DDA documents
- **Validation**: Ensure required fields are present and properly formatted
- **Metadata Extraction**: Identify domain, stakeholders, data entities, and relationships

### 2. Knowledge Graph Modeling
- **Domain Identification**: Automatically detect or specify the business domain
- **Entity Extraction**: Identify key data entities from requirements
- **Relationship Mapping**: Establish relationships between entities based on business rules
- **Attribute Definition**: Define properties and constraints for entities
- **Graph Persistence**: Store the modeled knowledge graph using Graphiti

### 3. Command Interface
- **Modeling Command**: Primary command for initiating the modeling workflow
- **Domain Specification**: Allow explicit domain definition or auto-detection
- **Iterative Updates**: Support updating existing knowledge graphs
- **Validation Feedback**: Provide feedback on modeling quality and completeness

### 4. Integration Points
- **Graphiti Integration**: Leverage Graphiti's graph and LLM capabilities
- **Agent Communication**: Enable collaboration with other agents (Data Engineer)
- **Repository Management**: Integrate with existing agent discovery and registration

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- Process DDA documents within 30 seconds for documents up to 50 pages
- Support concurrent modeling of multiple domains
- Efficient memory usage for large knowledge graphs

### Reliability
- Graceful handling of malformed or incomplete DDA documents
- Automatic backup of existing knowledge graphs before updates
- Error recovery and rollback capabilities

### Usability
- Clear feedback on modeling progress and results
- Detailed logging for debugging and audit trails
- Intuitive command syntax and help documentation

### Extensibility
- Plugin architecture for custom DDA parsers
- Configurable domain-specific modeling rules
- Support for custom entity and relationship types

## User Stories

### As a Data Architect
1. **I want to** process a new DDA document **so that** I can quickly create a knowledge graph for a new domain
2. **I want to** update an existing knowledge graph **so that** I can reflect changes in business requirements
3. **I want to** validate my modeling decisions **so that** I can ensure quality and completeness
4. **I want to** collaborate with the Data Engineer **so that** we can refine the model together

### As a Data Engineer
1. **I want to** receive modeling outputs **so that** I can understand the data architecture
2. **I want to** provide feedback on models **so that** I can influence the design based on implementation constraints
3. **I want to** access domain knowledge graphs **so that** I can make informed implementation decisions

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Successfully process DDA documents and create knowledge graphs
- [ ] Achieve 90% accuracy in entity and relationship extraction
- [ ] Complete modeling workflow within specified performance targets
- [ ] Enable seamless collaboration between Data Architect and Data Engineer agents
- [ ] Maintain backward compatibility with existing agent infrastructure
- [ ] Provide comprehensive test coverage for all modeling workflows

## Technical Constraints
- Must integrate with existing Graphiti infrastructure
- Must follow established command pattern architecture
- Must maintain compatibility with current agent communication protocols
- Must support the existing knowledge graph persistence layer
