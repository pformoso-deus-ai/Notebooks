# Development Plan

This plan outlines the tasks required to build the multi-agent system described in `PRD.md`.

## 1. Project Setup
- Initialize Python 3.12 project using `uv`.
- Configure linting (`ruff`/`flake8`) and formatting (`black`) with pre-commit hooks.
- Set up `pytest` for unit testing.
- Create initial folder structure following clean architecture (domain, application, infrastructure, interfaces).

## 2. Core Libraries
- Add `maLLMGraphTransformer` dependency.
- Add SDK module exposing programmatic interfaces for agent operations.
- Implement CLI entry points for common tasks (e.g. `execute-command`).

## 3. Knowledge Graph
- Set up Neo4J connection utilities.
- Implement graph transformation using `LLMGraphTransformer`.
- Provide repository layer for persisting and retrieving nodes/relationships.

## 4. Agent Implementation
- Architect (Arx) agent container with Dockerfile.
- Developer (D) agent container with Dockerfile.
- Implement Google A2A communication client.
- Abstract command interface for executing tasks.
- Implement base commands and handlers.

## 5. Deployment Helpers
- Write `Makefile` targets for building and running agents, e.g. `make run ROLE=arx`.
- Include configuration files and environment examples.

## 6. Testing
- Unit tests for command pattern, graph interaction, and communication flows.
- Continuous integration via pre-commit to ensure linting, formatting, and tests pass.

## 7. Documentation
- Update `README.md` with setup instructions, CLI usage, and development guidelines.
- Maintain API documentation within the SDK.
