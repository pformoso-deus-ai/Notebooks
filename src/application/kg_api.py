"""FastAPI interface for knowledge management events.

This module defines a lightweight HTTP API exposing a single `/events` endpoint.
Clients can POST a JSON payload describing a knowledge event along with the
role of the caller.  The event is published to the application layer's
event bus, which in turn dispatches it to the knowledge manager service.

Usage example::

    import requests
    payload = {
        "action": "create_entity",
        "data": {"id": "node1", "properties": {"name": "Example"}},
        "role": "data_architect"
    }
    resp = requests.post("http://localhost:8000/events", json=payload)
    print(resp.json())
