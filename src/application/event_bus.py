"""Simple asynchronous event bus.

The event bus allows publishers to emit events identified by an action
string.  Subscribers register callback coroutines for specific actions.
When an event is published the bus awaits each subscriber in turn.  This
implementation stores subscribers in memory and is suitable for unit
testing and small deployments.  A production system would integrate
RabbitMQ or a similar message broker and support delivery guarantees,
retry policies and dead‑letter queues.
